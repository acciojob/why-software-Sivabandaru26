  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and building solutions that can help people in their daily lives. 
    Technology inspires me as it has the power to connect the world, create opportunities, and make tasks easier. 
    I am motivated to continuously learn and improve my skills so that I can contribute to meaningful projects, 
    innovate with new ideas, and build a rewarding career in the software industry.
